    "text": "Photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. This energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water using energy from sunlight. In most cases, oxygen is also released as a byproduct, making this process essential for maintaining the oxygen levels in Earth's atmosphere and supporting aerobic life."

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, ensuring that once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This architecture allows for secure, transparent peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central clearing authority or intermediary."

This transition marked a major turning point in history, shifting from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing, and iron production processes. It also saw the increasing use of steam power and the development of machine tools, leading to an unprecedented rise in the standard of living and rapid population growth."

    "text": "Inflation is defined as a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. Central banks and monetary authorities generally attempt to limit inflation and avoid deflation to keep the economy running smoothly by managing the money supply and interest rates."

DNA molecules are two strands coiled around each other to form a double helix, carrying genetic information in the form of a sequence of four types of nucleotides. This structure allows genetic information to be accurately copied and passed down from parents to offspring."

The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined AI are frequently removed from the definition as they become routine capabilities."

Generally described as taking place from the 14th century to the 17th century, the Renaissance promoted the rediscovery of classical philosophy, literature, and art. Some of the greatest thinkers, authors, statesmen, scientists, and artists in human history thrived during this era, while global exploration opened up new lands and cultures to European commerce."

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon, which has a massive effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it."

It is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress. GDP per capita does not reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful."

Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, typically using a pay-as-you-go model which can help in reducing capital expenses."

It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics allows for the existence of particles in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition."

The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, catalyzed violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon. It brought many of the principles of liberal democracy, such as equality before the law, into the mainstream of political thought."

It teaches that the path to eudaimonia (happiness or blessedness) is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain. Stoics believed that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment and that a sage would not suffer such emotions."

These characteristics are the expressions of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organization, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules. The theory of evolution by natural selection was first formulated in Darwin's book 'On the Origin of Species'."

It postulates that, holding all else equal, in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity."

The movement originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. Impressionists rebelled against classical subject matter and embraced modernity."

Since tectonic processes began on Earth between 3.3 and 3.5 billion years ago, these plates have been moving slowly but continuously. This movement is responsible for many geological phenomena, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation."

This conflict causes feelings of unease or discomfort. To reduce this psychological stress, individuals may change their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors to make them consistent with one another, or they may justify or rationalize the discrepancies."
